        "title": "Never let a Unicorn Own a Bouncy Castle",
        "content": "Sage and her cousins, Grayon, Jasper, Dez, and Nina, were spending the afternoon in Aunty Cece’s backyard, playing with their dogs—Emika, Buster, Freya, Belle, Rocko, and Taco. It was a warm, sunny day, and the air smelled like fresh-cut grass.


"I have a surprise for you all!" Aunty Cece called out.


The kids turned and gasped. Right in the middle of the yard stood a gigantic, glittery bouncy castle! It had rainbow-colored walls, fluffy clouds at the top, and golden stars that sparkled in the sunlight.


Sage clapped her hands. "This is the best day ever!"


The kids raced toward the bouncy castle and took turns jumping as high as they could. Even the big dogs—Emika, Buster, Freya, Belle, and Rocko—tried to bounce, their tails wagging wildly. Little Taco stood at the edge, barking at the wiggly floor beneath his paws.


Just as they were all having the time of their lives, a swirl of shimmering water appeared in the air. Out of the sparkling mist, Mira the mermaid floated down with a giggle. And right beside her stood a unicorn. But this wasn't just any unicorn.


Her name was Luna, and she was covered in silver scales instead of fur, with a pearly, spiraled horn that glowed like the moon.


"I heard there was a bouncy castle!" Luna neighed happily, prancing forward.


Sage and her cousins exchanged nervous glances. A bouncy castle was made for kids... but a unicorn?


"Luna," Mira said with a smirk, "are you sure this is a good idea?"


"Of course!" Luna whinnied. "I’m an excellent bouncer!"


Before anyone could say another word, Luna leaped into the bouncy castle.


BOING!


Luna shot straight into the air, her hooves flailing.


BOING!


She bounced even higher, her mane flowing like a waterfall of moonlight.


BOING-BOING-BOING!


The bouncy castle wobbled, tilted, and then—


POP!


With a loud poof, the entire castle deflated, sending Sage, her cousins, the dogs, and Luna tumbling into a soft, squishy pile of colorful fabric.


For a moment, everything was silent.


Then Taco poked his tiny head out of the deflated castle, gave one dramatic sigh, and plopped over.


Luna winced. "Oops."


The kids burst into laughter. Even Aunty Cece shook her head with a smile.


"I guess unicorns shouldn't own bouncy castles," Sage giggled.


Luna grinned sheepishly. "Next time, I’ll stick to cloud trampolines."


Mira clapped her hands, and with a flick of her magic, the bouncy castle reinflated—good as new.


"Time for round two!" Grayon cheered.


And so, with a little magic, a lot of laughter, and one very excited unicorn, the bouncing fun continued—just with Luna watching from the sidelines this time.


The End."
